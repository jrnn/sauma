SAUMA
=====

Description
-----------

- Sauma is a small-scale app intended for use by one Finnish medium-size
  business specializing in the sealing of precast concrete element joints in
  building construction.
- The aim is that, by end of May 2018, Sauma is able to handle some basic
  project management and resource planning related features, such as
  1. keeping tabs on working sites, materials, and employees
  2. planning and scheduling tasks for sites, and assigning them to employees
  3. reporting used hours and materials against assigned tasks
  4. (and so on)
- UI is in Finnish due to the fact that all users are native Finns.
- This is done as an exercise project for a Helsinki University course on
  full stack web application development.
